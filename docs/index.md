### DVAE
Diffusion Variational Auto Encoder is a generative model that combines ideas from spectral manifold learning and variational inference.

A diagram depicting one step of the diffusion process modeled by the variational diffusion autoencoder (VDAE). The diffusion and inverse diffusion maps \$\psi, \psi^{-1}\$, as well as the covariance $\mathbf{C}$ of the random walk on $\mathcal{M}_Z$, are all approximated by neural networks. Images on the leftmost panel are actually generated by our method
